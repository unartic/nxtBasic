# Graphics

The Commander x16 is equiped with a VERA with 128kb of video ram (VRAM). It has two layers (layer0 and layer1) and per layer you can specify if it is a bitmap layer or a tilemap. (textmode is just a tilemap). On ntop of that VERA can handle 128 individual sprites.

For a bitmap layer, tiles in a tilemap and sprites, you can specify how many colors it contains:
- 2 colors (1 bit per pixel)
- 4 colors (2 bits per pixel)
- 16 colors (4 bits per pixel)
- 256 colors (8 bits per pixel)

Depending on the amount of colors you have to specify graphic files with the correct amount of bytes. If you have a 256 color tile of 16x16 pixels, then you should use a 16x16=256 byte graphic file, where each byte contains a value that corresponds with one of the 256 colors in the palette.

If you have a 16 color tile of 16x16 pixels, you can store 2 pixels into one byte, so you need half the size for the graphic. Conveniently, besides the amout of colors, you can also specify a palette offset. The specified pallete offset. If you specify the pallette offset to 16 for example, and use color index 2, you are actualy displaying color 18 of the full 256 color palette. 

nxtBasic has several functions to work in an efficient way with the graphics capabilities.

# SCREEN
With the screen command, you can set the desired screen mode for your application:

****Syntax:****
    SCREEN number
    
****Example:****
    
    SCREEN 0	'80x60 text
    SCREEN 1	'80x30 text
    SCREEN 2	'40x60 text
    SCREEN 3	'40x30 text
    SCREEN 4	'40x15 text
    SCREEN 5	'20x30 text
    SCREEN 6	'20x15 text
    SCREEN 7	'22x23 text
    SCREEN 8	'64x50 text
    SCREEN 9	'64x25 text
    SCREEN 10	'32x50 text
    SCREEN 11	'32x25 text
    SCREEN 128	'320x240@256c, 40x30 text   
    
The last screen mode (128) sets VERA up to have two active layers:
- Layer0 will be a 256 color bitmap layer with a resolution of 320x240 pixe;s
- Layer1 will be a textmode layer with 40 columns and 30 rows

Future versions of nxtBasic will support more screen modes out of the box, if you want to use any other combinations of configured layers, you can set specific registers to do so. Consult the Commander x16 documentation for more information.

## CURSCREENMODE
Returns the current screen mode. See SCREEN statement for possible return values.

****Syntax:****

    varInt = CURSCREENMODE
    
****Example:****

    PRINT CURSCREENMODE     

## GETCOLS
Returns the amount columns of the current text mode screen.

****Syntax:****

    varInt = GETCOLS()
    
****Example:****

    PRINT GETCOLS()

## GETROWS
Returns the amount rows of the current text mode screen.

****Syntax:****

    varInt = GETROWS()
    
****Example:****

    PRINT GETROWS()

## Sprite Functions
Sprites are two-dimensional images used to represent characters, objects, or other visual elements in your programs. Sprites are defined once and can be displayed all over the screen very quick and performand.

## ADDSPRITE

The ADDSPRITE function loads a sprite from a file or vram and configures it .

**Syntax:**

    ADDSPRITE file/address, width, height, colordepth, paletteoffset
    
- file/address: The name of the file containing the sprite image or an address in VRAM to display the sprite from. So you can specify a file which will be loaded into vram automaticly or you can load the sprite yourself (for example via BVLOAD) and specify the address in vram of where the sprite is. 
- width: The width of the sprite in pixels.
- height: The height of the sprite in pixels.
- colordepth: The number of colors used in the sprite.
  - 4 = 4 bits per pixel -> 16 colors
  - 8 = 8 bits per pixel -> 256 colors
- paletteoffset: The starting index in the color palette (not used if set to 8bpp).

**Example:**

    index = ADDSPRITE("sprite.img", 32, 32, 8, 0)
    
After using ADDSPRITE the VRAM-address in which the sprite image is stored, can be retrieved via GETA() (low-byte), GETX() (middle byte), GETY() (high byte/bank)
    
# Adding a sprite from VRAM
If you want to load the sprite into vram yourself and just point ADDSPRITE to it, you need to seperate the bank and address part. For example, you have loaded your sprite into vram adress $14000. You have to split this into the bank ($01) and the address ($4000). To pass the bank to ADDSPRITE you put it in the LDY function and the address in ADDSPRITE.

**Example:**

    LDY $01
    index = ADDSPRITE($4000, 32, 32, 8, 0)
    
This will configure a sprite from vram address $14000.

## CLONESPRITE

The CLONESPRITE function creates a clone of a sprite that was added with ADDSPRITE. If you want to display the same sprite multiple times, you can first add it with ADDSPRITE and then clone it as often as you need. When cloning only the configuration part is cloned. So the actual image data is reused.

**Syntax:**

    NewIndex = CLONESPRITE(index)

index: The index of the sprite to clone.

**Example:**

    cloneIndex = CLONESPRITE(1)

## SHOWSPRITE

The SHOWSPRITE function displays a sprite at a specific position and depth.

**Syntax:**

    SHOWSPRITE index, x, y, zdepth 
    
- index: The index of the sprite to show.
- x: The x-coordinate to display the sprite.
- y: The y-coordinate to display the sprite.
- zdepth: The 'layer' to display the sprite. 
    - 0=hide sprite
    - 1=between background and layer0
    - 2=between layer0 and layer1
    - 3=in front of layer1

**Example:**

    SHOWSPRITE 1, 100, 150, 1

## MOVESPRITE

The MOVESPRITE function moves a sprite by a specified amount of pixels in horizontal and/or vertical direction.

**Syntax:**

    MOVESPRITE index, dx, dy
    
index: The index of the sprite to move.
dx: The amount of pixels to move the sprite along the x-axis.
dy: The amount of pixels to move the sprite along the y-axis.

**Example:**

    index = ADDSPRITE("sprite.bin",16,16,8,0)
    SHOWSPRITE index,100,100,3
    FOR i = 1 to 10
        MOVESPRITE index, i, i  'moves the sprite in increasing 
                                'steps to the right bottom of the screen
    NEXT

## SPRITECOL
Returns a string of all sprite indices that are currently overlapping with the specified sprite index.

**Syntax:**

    varString$ = SPRITECOL(index)
    
index: The index of the sprite.

The string that's being returned has one byte for each sprite that it is overlapping with. So if it overlaps with 2 other sprites, the length of the string is 2.

Each ascii value of each byte in the string represents the sprite index it is overlapping with. 

**Example:**

    'Get a string of all sprites sprite 1 is overlapping with
    c$ = SPRITECOL(1)
    
    'Print the sprite index of the first sprite that it is overlapping with
    PRINT ASC(left(c$,1))
    
    

## SPRITEGETX

The SPRITEGETX function returns the current x-coordinate of a sprite.

**Syntax:**

    x = SPRITEGETX(index)
    
index: The index of the sprite.

**Example:**

    xPos = SPRITEGETX(1)
    
SPRITEGETX also loads the Y-coordinate low byte in the pseudo processor register Y. This is handy when performance is ciritical. So the following example will get both the X and Y value of a sprite:

**Example:**

    xPos = SPRITEGETX(1)
    yPos = GETY()
    
However, as GETY() will only return the low byte, the Y value will only be correct if the value you expect is less then 256. This will be fine if you only have sprites in the visible region of the screen and the number of rows on the screen is 240 max.

## SPRITEGETY

The SPRITEGETY function returns the current y-coordinate of a sprite.

**Syntax:**

    y = SPRITEGETY(index)

- index: The index of the sprite.

**Example:**

    yPos = SPRITEGETY(0)


## SPRITEHFLIP

The SPRITEHFLIP function flips a sprite horizontally. This does not actualy alter the sprite image data, but only draws the sprite flipped.

**Syntax:**

    SPRITEHFLIP index 
    
index: The index of the sprite.

**Example:**

    SPRITEHFLIP 1
    
## SPRITEVFLIP

The SPRITEVFLIP function flips a sprite vertically. This does not actualy alter the sprite image data, but only draws the sprite flipped.

**Syntax:**

    SPRITEVFLIP(index)

index: The index of the sprite.

**Example:**

    SPRITEVFLIP 1
    
# Bitmap Functions
Bitmap functions allow you to manipulate bitmap layers in your programs. The more or less official bitmap file for the Commander x16 is the BMX-file. nxtBasic has full support for this file format.

## DRAWBMX

The DRAWBMX function loads a BMX file to a bitmap layer as a specific location. Currently only 256 color bitmap layers are supported.

As a BMX can contain palette data, if palette data is encountered, the current palette will be altered. So if you use several BMX files, make sure the use the same palette.

**Syntax:**

    DRAWBMX filename, x, y

- filename: The name of the BMX file.
- x: The x-coordinate where the bitmap will be drawn.
- y: The y-coordinate where the bitmap will be drawn.

**Syntax:**

    width = GETBMXWIDTH(filename)

- filename: The name of the BMX file.

**Example:**

    width = GETBMXWIDTH("image.bmx")

## GETBMXHEIGHT
