# File Handling 

File handling in nxtBasic allows your programs to read from and write to files on storage devices aswell as saving and reading files from and to memory. This section will cover the basic operations of opening, reading, writing, and closing files.

The emulator can work with the file system of the host (HOSTFS). However, this will behave pretty differently from the SD-Card. For proper testing any file system related functions, it is strongly advisable to use an image of an sd-card attached to the emulator, or test from a sd-card on the real hardware.

If you specify a filename and you're not in iso-mode, specify them in capital letters. Else running on real hardware (or a virtucal sd-card on the emulator will result in an error, where the file can not be found.

# Opening a File
To open a file (or a channel), you can use the OPEN or OPENFILE statement. The OPEN statement gives you full control over all parameters, OPENFILE is easier to use. If you need to open a file on a device other then device 8, you can use SETDEVICE

## OPENFILE

**Syntax:**

    fileNumber = OPENFILE("filename",{MODE})
    


- fileNumber: A unique number identifying the file between 1 and 13 (14 is used internaly by nxtBasic and therefor can better not be used)
- filename: The name of the file
- MODE: can be FOR_READ, FOR_WRITE or COMMAND
  
**Example:**

    filenumber = OPENFILE("TEST.TXT",FOR_READ)  'Opens FILE.TXT for reading
    filenumber = OPENFILE("TEST.TXT",FOR_WRITE)  'Opens FILE.TXT for writing
    filenumber = OPENFILE("$",COMMAND)  'Opens the command channel with command "$" (list directory)


## OPEN

**Syntax:**

    OPEN fileNumber, deviceNumber, channel, "filename"


- fileNumber: A unique number identifying the file between 1 and 13 (14 is used internaly by nxtBasic and therefor can better not be used)
- deviceNumber: The number of the device (8 for disk drive, 1 for tape, etc.) You'll normaly always set it to 8.
- channel: The communication channel. Use 0 for reading and 1 for writing
- filename: The name of the file
  
**Example:**

    OPEN 1,8,0,"FILE.TXT"   'open file for reading
    OPEN 2,8,1,"FILE.TXT"   'open file for writing

## SETDEVICE
The default device nxtBasic uses is device 8 for all file operations. If you want to use an other device number, you can use SETDEVICE

**Syntax:**
    
    SETDEVICE devicenr
    
**Example:**

    SETDEVICE 9     'all file operations will be done on device 9 from this point

# Reading from a File
To read data from an opened file, use the INPUT# or GET# statement.

## INPUT# statement
Reads a line, ended by a linefeed (chr 13) from the file.

**Syntax:**

    variable$ = INPUT#(fileNumber)

**Example:**
    
    OPEN 1,9,0,"FILE.TXT"
    a$ = INPUT#(1)
    PRINT "The first line of this file is: " 
    PRINT a$
    CLOSE 1

## LINPUT# statement
Reads a line, until a specified character is found.

**Syntax:**

    variable$ = LINPUT#(fileNumber,char)

- FileNumber:   the filenumber used to open the file
- Char:         the character until LINPUT# read

**Example:**
    
    OPEN 1,9,0,"FILE.TXT"
    a$ = LINPUT#(1,"A")
    PRINT a$
    CLOSE 1


## BINPUT#
Reads a block of data from an open file and stores it in a string variable. 

**Syntax:**

    variable$ = BINPUT#(filenumber,length)

**Example:**

    OPEN 1,9,0,"FILE.TXT"
    a$ = BINPUT#(1,15)
    PRINT "The first 15 bytes of the file are: " 
    PRINT a$
    CLOSE 1

## GET# statement

Reads one byte from an open file.

**Syntax:**

    variable$ = GET#(fileNumber)

**Example:**

    OPEN 1,9,0,"FILE.TXT"
    a$ = GET#(1)
    PRINT "The first byte of this file is: " + a$
    CLOSE 1
 

# Writing to a File
To write data to an opened file, use the PRINT#.

**Syntax:**

    PRINT# fileNumber, expression
    
**Example:**

    OPEN 2,8,1,"FILE.TXT"
    PRINT# 2, "This is a line of text"
    PRINT# 2, "Another line"
    CLOSE 2
    
By ending the statement with a semicolon a linefeed (chr 13) will not be written to the file.

    OPEN 2,8,1,"FILE.TXT"
    PRINT# 2, "This is a line of text";
    PRINT# 2, "Another line"
    CLOSE 2

# Closing a File
Always close files when you are done with them to free up system resources.

**Syntax:**

    CLOSE fileNumber

**Example:**

    OPEN 1,8,0,"FILE.TXT"
    ' ... read from the file ...
    CLOSE 1

# Checking for End of File
After a read, you can check with EOF if the end of an opened file has been reached during the last read statement.

**Syntax:**


    status = EOF
    
**Example:**

    OPEN 1,8,0,"FILE.TXT"
    ReadLoop:
        a$ = a$ + GET#(1)
        IF EOF THEN Goto ReachedEOF
    Goto ReadLoop
    ReachedEOF:
    CLOSE 1

# FILEEXISTS function

To check if a file exists in the current directory, you can use FILEEXISTS.

**Syntax:**

    result = FILEEXISTS(filename)
    
**Example:**
    
    IF FILEEXISTS("FILE.TXT") THEN
        'Execute code when the file exists
    ELSE
        'Execute code when the file does not exists
    END IF

# CURDIR$ function
Returns the currenct directory. As the default charset (petscii/graph) is not realy able to display lower case letters (where directory names can be lower case), it is best to switch to ISO before you use this function. Or you should uppercase the result before displaying.

**Syntax:**

    varString = CURDIR$
    
**Example:**
    
    ENTERISO
    PRINT CURDIR$

# DIRLIST/DIRITEM functions
DIRLIST and DIRITEM, DIRITEMDATE, DIRITEMTIME and DIRITEMSIZE allow you to read a directory listing based on a filter. Think of DOS"$" on X16, "ls" on linux or "dir" on windows/dos.

Due to how X16 handles filtering, the filter optioned are different then whay you might expect.

**Syntax:**

    varInt = DIRLIST(cmdrFilter,Extension,Type)
    varString = DIRITEM()

To start reading a direcory listing, you first need to define the filter with DIRLIST.
- cmdrFilter:   a string containing a filter like CMDR-dos needs. These are the options you can work with:
  - "*":    no filter
  - "A*":   all list items starting with an A (not case sensitivw)
  - "ABC":  only files with the exact name: "ABC"
- Extension:    With the extension filter, you can filter out only list items with a specific exension:
  - "*":    no filter
  - "PRG":  only list items with PRG as their extension.
- Type:     The type-filter allows you to only return files, only return directories or return any:
  - LIST_ALL:       no filter
  - LIST_FILES:     only files
  - LIST_DIRS:      only directories
  
DIRLIST will return an integer containing the amouont of listitems that matches the filter arguments.

After calling DIRLIST, you can retrieve the list items one at a time with DIRITEM(). DIRITEM() will return a string with the file/directory name of the next list item. The order in which list items are retrieved is determined by the file system.

DIRITEM() return the filename as retrieved from the file system. These can contain uppercase, lowercase and non-letters/digits. If you are in ISO-mode you can just print them out and they appear ok. If you are in one of the petscii-modes, lower case characters will not be displayed correctly. You can use UCASE$() to make them upper-case, which improves readability.

In order to retrieve the file date, time and size, you can use DIRITEMDATE(), DIRITEMTIME() and DIRITEMSIZE() after you've retrieved the file/directory name with DIRITEM(). The order in which you get the date, time and size MUST be in that order: date, time, size. It is not possible to first retrieve the size and then the date for example. Returning only the size (so skipping the date and time) is not a problem. As long as the order is correct.

The file size is always retrieved in an amount les then 32767. After calling DIRITEMSIZE() the value in GETA() determines if the retrieved value are bytes, kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes.

CLOSEDIRLIST() must be called when you are done with retrieving the current directory listing.

**Example:**
    
    ENTERISO

    PRINT
    PRINT CurDir$
    PRINT RPT$("-",45)
    PRINT "FILE";
    SETCOL 20
    PRINT "DATE";
    SETCOL 31
    PRINT "TIME";
    SETCOL 41
    PRINT "SIZE"
    PRINT RPT$("-",45)

    cnt = DIRLIST("*","*",LIST_ALL)
    for i = 1 to cnt
        PRINT DIRITEM()+" ";
        SETCOL 20
        PRINT DIRITEMDATE()+" ";
        SETCOL 31
        PRINT DIRITEMTIME()+" ";
        SETCOL 40
        PRINT DIRITEMSIZE()+" ";
        c = GETA()
        if c = 0 then
            PRINT "b"
        elseif c = 1 then
            PRINT "kb"
        elseif c = 2 then
            PRINT "mb"
        else
            PRINT "gb"
        end if
        
    next

    CLOSELIST() 


# BLOAD/BSAVE
Loads a binary file directly into ram. This function can best be used to load a file into highram.

If a file does not fit in one rambank (8kb), consequtive rambanks will be used automaticly.

After this function has been used, you can check memory location $00 to find the last used rambank, and memortlocations $030D and $030E for the address of the final byte loaded plus 1.

**Syntax:**

    BLOAD filename, bank, address
    
- Filename: the name of the file y ou want to load
- bank: the bank to start writing the contents of the file
- address: the address where writing should start

**Examples:**

    'LOADS A FILE NAMED DATAFILE.BIN FROM DEVICE 8 STARTING IN BANK 15 AT $A000
    BLOAD "DATAFILE.BIN",15,$A000  

## BSAVE
Saves a portion of ram to a file.

**Syntax:**

    BSAVE filename, bank, startaddress, endaddress

- Filename: the name of the file you want to save to
- bank: the bank to start reading the content to write to a file
- startaddress: save memory starting at this address
- endaddress: the end of the memory region you want to save

**NOTE:** BSAVE in nxtBasic does NOT store a 2 byte header in the file containing the memory location it is saved from.

**Examples:**

    ' SAVES MEMORY FROM $A000 IN BANK 1 TO $BFFF, STOPPING BEFORE $C000
    BSAVE "MEMORY.DMP",1,$A000,$C000
