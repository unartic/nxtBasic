# Labels

Within nxtBasic you can use line numbers as labels like in CBM Basic. However, a more practical way of using labels is like more modern languages:

    MyLabel:
    
To jump to a specific label within your program you can use:

    Goto MyLabel
    
To jump to a specific label within your program and return to the location you jumped from, you can do this:

    Gosub MyLabel
    PRINT "THIS WILL BE PRINTED SECOND"
    
    MyLabel:
        PRINT "THIS WILL BE PRINTED FIRST"
    return
