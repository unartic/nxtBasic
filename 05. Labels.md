# Labels

Within nxtBasic you can use line numbers as labels like in CBM Basic. However, a more practical way of using labels is like more modern languages:

    MyLabel:

## GOTO
    
To jump to a specific label within your program you can use:

    Goto MyLabel


## GOSUB
To jump to a specific label within your program and return to the location you jumped from, you can do this:

    Gosub MyLabel
    PRINT "THIS WILL BE PRINTED SECOND"
    
    MyLabel:
        PRINT "THIS WILL BE PRINTED FIRST"
    return
    
## SYS
The SYS statement does the same as the GOSUB statement, however instead of specifying a label, you specify an address in memory. This is normaly used to directly call a kernal subroutine.

In addition you are likely to want to set one or more of the processor registers. You can use LDA, LDX and LDY to do so.

**Syntax:**

    SYS address
    
**Example:**

    LDA "A"     'puts a "A" in the accumulator
    SYS $FFD2   'Calls the kernal CHROUT subroutine to print the A on the screen
    
## LDA, LDX and LDY
These statements can be used before calling the SYS statement. They will load the processor registers with the specified valies, beforw jumping to the address given in the SYS command. The argument passed can be an integer value between 0 and 255 or a one byte string.

**Example:**

    LDA $41
    LDA "A"
    LDA 65
    LDA %01000001

These examples will all do exactly the same thing: load a value of $41 in the accumulator.

## GETA, GETX and GETY
After a SYS statement has been executed, you can get the values in the processor registers with these functions.

**Syntax:**

    varINT = GETA
    
**Example:**

    LDA "A"     'puts a "A" in the accumulator
    SYS $FFD2   'Calls the kernal CHROUT subroutine to print the A on the screen
    PRINT GETA  'as the accumulator is not changed by CHROUT, this will return the value 65
