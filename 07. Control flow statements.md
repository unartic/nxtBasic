# Control flow statements

In nxtBasic, conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on specific conditions. These statements enable your code to make decisions and execute different paths depending on those decisions. The primary conditional statements in nxtBasic are IF, ELSEIF, ELSE, and END IF.

## IF statement

The IF statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. It is the fundamental building block of conditional logic.

**Syntax:**

    IF (condition) THEN
        ' code to execute if condition is true
    END IF
    
**Example:**

    IF x > 10 THEN
        PRINT "x is greater than 10"
    END IF


## ELSEIF Statement

The ELSEIF statement follows an IF statement and allows you to test additional conditions if the previous IF or ELSEIF condition was false. It enables handling multiple conditions sequentially.

**Syntax:**

    IF (condition1) THEN
        ' code to execute if condition1 is true
    ELSEIF (condition2) THEN
        ' code to execute if condition2 is true
    END IF

**Example:**

    IF x > 10 THEN
        PRINT "x is greater than 10"
    ELSEIF x = 10 THEN
        PRINT "x is exactly 10"
    END IF

## ELSE Statement

The ELSE statement catches all conditions that were not met by the preceding IF or ELSEIF statements. It ensures that a block of code is executed if none of the previous conditions are true.

**Syntax:**

    IF (condition1) THEN
        ' code to execute if condition1 is true
    ELSEIF (condition2) THEN
        ' code to execute if condition2 is true
    ELSE
        ' code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
    END IF

**Example:**

    IF x > 10 THEN
        PRINT "x is greater than 10"
    ELSEIF x = 10 THEN
        PRINT "x is exactly 10"
    ELSE
        PRINT "x is less than 10"
    END IF


#Looping Constructs

Looping constructs in nxtBasic allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. This section covers the FOR, BREAK, CONTINUE, and NEXT statements.

## FOR Loop

The FOR loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times. It is particularly useful for iterating over arrays or ranges.

**Syntax:**

    FOR counter = start TO end [STEP step]
        ' code to execute in each iteration
    NEXT

**Example:**

    FOR i = 1 TO 5
        PRINT i
    NEXT

## BREAK Statement

The BREAK statement exits the loop immediately, regardless of the iteration count or condition.

**Syntax:**
    FOR counter = start TO end
        IF (condition) THEN
            BREAK
        END IF
        ' other code
    NEXT

**Example:**

    FOR i = 1 TO 10
        IF i = 5 THEN
            BREAK
        END IF
        PRINT i
    NEXT

## CONTINUE Statement
The CONTINUE statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop.

**Syntax:**

    FOR counter = start TO end
        IF (condition) THEN
            CONTINUE
        END IF
        ' other code
    NEXT
    
**Example:**

    FOR i = 1 TO 10
        IF i=7 THEN
            CONTINUE
        END IF
        PRINT i
    NEXT
    
## DO/LOOP
nxtBasic supports the loop construct DO WHILE / LOOP and DO UNTIL / LOOP. The program will loop within the DO and LOOP statement until the condition is reached.

**Syntax:**

    DO WHILE|UNTIL {condition}
    
    LOOP
    
**Example:**

    DO WHILE a<10
        a=a+1
    LOOP
    
If you do not include the WHILE or UNTIL keyword, the loop will be indefinite.

**Example:**

    DO
        a=a+1
        PRINT a
    LOOP
    
### EXIT LOOP
If you want to exit the do-loop construct immediatly, you can use EXIT LOOP.

**Example:**

    DO WHILE a<10
        a=a+1
        if a = 5 then exit loop
    LOOP
    
### HLT
If you want to stop execution (for debug reasons) you can use the HLT command.

**Example:**

    DO WHILE a<10
        a=a+1
        if a = 5 then HLT       'Will halt exectues when a reached the value 5
    LOOP
