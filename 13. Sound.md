# Sound

The Commander x16 is equiped with a PSG, YM-chip and PCM-output. The current version of nxtBasic had native support for PSG, YM and PCM.

# PCM
The default file format for pcm-sound is ZCM. ZCM files are more or less the same as WAV-files, but with a different header. nxtBasic currently only support playing of ZCM-files.

## PLAYZCM

**Syntax:**
 
    PLAYZCM filename,volume

- filename:  the filename of the zcm-file to play
- volume: a value between 0 and 16 indicating the volume to play the zcm file at



**Example:**

    PLAYZCM "FILE.ZCM",10

The Commander X16 has a 4kb buffer for the sound data. When PLAYZCM is called the first 4kb of sound data are loaded into the buffer. If there is less then 4kb of sound data, nxtBasic will close the file and playing stops when the buffer is empty.

If there is more then 4kb of zcm data, you need to call ZCMTICK within your main loop. When calling ZCMTICK nxtBasic checks if the buffer is less then 1/4 full, if so: it fills the buffer from the file. The zcm-file remains open during playback.

## ZCMTICK

**Example**:
    
    ZCMTICK
    
Call this function whenever a zcm-file is being played to have nxtBasic keep the audio buffer filled. You can call this function as fast as you want. If the function is not called in time, the audio playback will be interrupted.

## STOPZCM
Stops playback of ZCM-file, and closes it.

# ZSM
A ZSM file is essentialy a file containing musical information. It can address the YM-chip, PSG registers and PCM audio. nxtBasic supports playback of zsm-files. Only pcm audio (if present in a zsm file) is not played. This will be added in a later version

## PLAYZSM

**Syntax:**
 
    PLAYZSM filename,volume,rambank

- filename:  the filename of the zcm-file to play
- volume: a value between 0 and 127 indicating the volume to play the zcm file at
- rambank:  nxtBasic needs a free rambank to buffer the contents of the zsm-file



**Example:**

    PLAYZSM "FILE.ZCM",20,10

## ZSMTICK

**Example**:
    
    ZSMTICK
    
To fill up the buffer with zsm-data, you need to call this function frequently. You can call it as frequent as you like. If you do not call it frequently enough, music will halt.

## STOPZSM
Stops playback of zsm-file, and closes it.

# YM2151

The Yamaha YM2151: 8 channels, FM synthesis chip can be accessed in various ways with the following statements.

## FMINIT
Initializes the YM2151, silences all channels, and loads default instrument patches into all 8 channels.

- Channel 0:    Piano
- Channel 1:    Electric Piano
- Channel 2:    Vibraphone 
- Channel 3:    Fretless 
- Channel 4:    Violin 
- Channel 5:    Trumpet 
- Channel 6:    Blown Bottle 
- Channel 7:    Fantasia 


**Syntax:** 

    FMINIT



## FMINST
Loads an instrument into a specified channel of the YM2151 using a patch preset. Valid channels range from 0 to 7. Valid patches range from 0 to 162.

**Syntax:**
 
    FMINST channel,patch

**Example:**

    'Loads Violin into channel 0
    FMINST 0,40 
    

## FMVOL
Sets the volume level for a specific channel. The volume will stay at the set level until another FMVOL command is issued for that channel or FMINIT is called. Valid range is from 0 (mute) to 63 (maximum volume).

**Syntax:** 
    
    FMVOL channel,volume

**Example:**

    FMVOL 0,30  ' SET CHANNEL 0 VOLUME TO 30
    FMVOL 1,45  ' SET CHANNEL 1 VOLUME TO 45
    
## FMCHORD
Plays multiple notes simultaneously on one or more channels, starting from the specified first channel. The first note in the string is played on the first channel, and subsequent notes are played on subsequent channels. Channels wrap around after channel 7 to channel 0.

All macros supported by PSGPLAY and FMPLAY are also supported by FMCHORD.

**Syntax:** 

    FMCHORD channel,string


**Example:**

    FMINIT
    FMVIB 200,20
    FMINST 2,34 ' LOAD SYNTH PATCH INTO CHANNEL 2
    FMINST 3,34 ' LOAD SAME SYNTH PATCH INTO CHANNEL 3
    FMINST 4,34 ' LOAD SAME SYNTH PATCH INTO CHANNEL 4
    FMVOL 2,50
    FMVOL 3,50
    FMVOL 4,50
    FMCHORD 2,"O4CEG" ' PLAY CHORD ON CHANNELS 2, 3, AND 4

This will play a chord with a synth patch on channels 2, 3, and 4.

## FMPLAY
Executes a string of musical notes, rests, tempo changes, and other commands synchronously on the specified channel. The FMPLAY command does not return control until the entire string is processed.

**Syntax:**

    FMPLAY channel,string


**Example:**

    FMINIT
    FMINST 0,52             ' LOAD ELECTRIC PIANO PATCH
    FMPLAY 0,"T120 O3 L4"   ' SET TEMPO TO 120 BPM, OCTAVE 3, QUARTER NOTE LENGTH
    FMPLAY 0,"CDEFGAB>C"    ' PLAY A SIMPLE SCALE
    FMPLAY 0,"C<BAGFEDC"    ' PLAY THE SCALE IN REVERSE
    

## FMFREQ
Plays a note on the YM2151 by specifying its frequency in Hz. Valid frequency range is from 17 to 4434 Hz. A frequency of 0 releases the note.

**Syntax:**
 
    FMFREQ channel,frequency


**Example:**

    FMINST 0,110    ' LOAD ORGAN PATCH
    FMFREQ 0,440    ' PLAY A4 (440 HZ)
    SLEEP 30        ' Delay
    FMFREQ 0,0      ' RELEASE NOTE

This plays an A4 note (440 Hz) for a short period.

## FMVIB
Sets the LFO speed and modulation depth for the YM2151. The speed ranges from 0 to 255, corresponding to an LFO frequency from 0.008 Hz to 32.6 Hz. The depth ranges from 0 to 127 and affects both amplitude and phase modulation.

Only certain patches are sensitive to the LFO. Instruments marked with the â€  symbol in the instrument table are affected.

**Syntax:**

    FMVIB speed,depth

**Example:**

    FMVIB 210,25
    FMINST 0,60  ' LOAD SYNTH BASS PATCH
    FMPLAY 0,"T100 O2 G2A2B2C3"
    FMVIB 0,0
    FMPLAY 0,"C3B2A2G2"
    
This program plays a bass line with vibrato first, then without vibrato.

## FMPOKE
Writes a value to one of the YM2151's registers at a low level using the AUDIO API.

**Syntax:**
 
    FMPOKE register,value


**Example:**


    FMINIT
    FMPOKE $28,$50 ' SET NOTE D5 (D-587) ON CHANNEL 0
    FMPOKE $08,$00 ' RELEASE CHANNEL 0
    FMPOKE $08,$78 ' START NOTE PLAYBACK ON CHANNEL 0 WITH ALL OPERATORS

# PSG (Programmable Sound Generator)
The PSG can simultaniously output 4 waveforms on 16 different channels.

**Syntax:**

    PSGINIT



**Example:**

    PSGINIT

## PSGCHORD
Plays multiple notes simultaneously on one or more voices, starting from the specified first voice. The first note in the string is played on the first voice, and subsequent notes are played on subsequent voices. Voices wrap around after voice 15 to voice 0.

All macros supported by PSGPLAY and FMPLAY are also supported by PSGCHORD.

**Syntax:**

    PSGCHORD firstvoice,string

**Example:**

    PSGINIT
    PSGCHORD 14,"O3E>GB"        ' STARTS PLAYING A CHORD ON VOICES 14, 15, AND 0

## PSGWAV
Sets the waveform and duty cycle for a PSG voice.

- w = 0-63 -> Pulse: Duty cycle is (w+1)/128. A value of 63 means 50% duty.
- w = 64-127 -> Sawtooth (all values have identical effect)
- w = 128-191 -> Triangle (all values have identical effect)
- w = 192-255 -> Noise (all values have identical effect)

**Syntax:**

    PSGWAV voice,w

**Example:**

    FOR O=$30 TO $60 STEP $10   ' OCTAVE LOOP
        FOR N=0 TO 11 STEP 2        ' NOTE LOOP, EVERY OTHER NOTE
            PSGNOTE 1,O+N           ' START PLAYBACK OF THE NOTE
            FOR P=0 TO 30           ' PULSE WIDTH MODULATION LOOP (INCREASING DUTY)
                PSGWAV 1,P          ' SET PULSE WIDTH
                SLEEP 30
            NEXT P
            PSGNOTE 1,O+N+1         ' START PLAYBACK OF THE NOTE + A SEMITONE
            FOR P=30 TO 1 STEP -1   ' PWM LOOP (DECREASING DUTY)
                PSGWAV 1,P          ' SET PULSE WIDTH
                SLEEP 30
            NEXT P
        NEXT N
    NEXT O
    PSGNOTE 1,0 ' STOP SOUND
    
This example plays a chromatic scale while applying pulse-width modulation on the voice.
