# Variables

In nxtBasic you do not need to declare any variables. Ofcourse, you can, but it is not necesary. Variable names can be of any length and are always unique in the way day are defined. If you want to force the need for variable declaration, you can add "OPTION EXPLICT" in your source file. if nxtBasic encounters this, it will only create a variable if it is declared with DIM.


nxtBasic supports 3 types of veriables:


## 1. Strings
Strings are dynamic and can be up to 1024 bytes in length. When a value is set to a string variable, nxtBasic reserves the amount of bytes needed + approximatly 10% in the high memory region of the Commander x16. The extra reserved memory allows strings to grow, without having to relocate the content, if the new length exceeds the reserverd space. If a string grows beyond its original reservers size, the string data is relocated to a new continues block of memory. This however gragments the veriable memory space.

To declare and use string variables you can do one of the folling:

    MyString$="HELLO"      

        or
        
    Dim MyString$
    
        or
        
    Dim MyString$ as string
    
        or
        
    Dim MyString as string

As you see, you can explicitly set a type with the 'AS' constructor, or you can use a $-sign at the end of the variable name, to mark it as a string.

**String space**
When default settings are used, stringdata is stored in rambank $05 to $0F (5 to 15), addressing 80kb of the high ram memory space for storage of strings. If needed, the maximum string space can be ajusted.

## 2. Integers

Integers are 16bit signed. This means they can have a value between -32.768 and 32.767. nxtBasic is highly optimized to use integers, both in performance as in storage of data, including integer arrays. 

Therefor the default variable type for nxtBasic is an integer. 

To declare and use an integer, you can do one of the following:


    MyInt=100      

        or
        
    Dim MyInt
    
        or
        
    Dim MyInt as int
    

**Integers with a value above 32.767**

nxtBasic partialy supports unsigned 16 bit integers. For example you can set an integer with a higher value like this:
    
    MyInteger = 50000
    
However, when you print out the value, you'll get a negative number. That is not a problem if you pass the variable to many of the buildin functions. For example:

    Adr = 40960             'equevalent of $A000
    POKEN Adr,"MYSTRING"    'Stores the value "MYSTRING" to memory location $A000
    
will work totaly fine. 

When performing math with integers that you'll treat as unsigned, you can onlye add or subtract. Multiply and divide, will give you an unexpected result.

**Assigning a value**

There are three ways of assigning a value to an integer:
    
    MyInt = 100
    MyInt = $64
    MyInt = %01100100
    
    MyInt = $6410
    MyInt = %0110010000010000

The $-character indicates a 8bit or 16bit hexadecimal value

The %-character indicates a 8bit or 16bit binary value 

## 3. Floating points

Floating point variables have a precision of 32bits and can be a value between -3.4028235 × 10^38 and 3.4028235 × 10^38. Using floating points should be avoided as much as possible, as performance is bad. Only if you realy need very big or very small numbers they should be used.

To declare and use a floatingpoint, you can do this:

    Dim MyFloat as float

Assigns a value like this:

    MyFloat = 5.654
    
Function like COS, SIN, TAN, SQRT etc always returen a floating point type.

## Constants
nxtBasic supports any number of constants. Names of constants should not be identical to function names, labels or variable names.

**Syntax:**

    CONST name = valur
    
**Example:**

    CONST myConst = "HELLO"
    CONST five = 5
    PRINT myConst
    PRINT five 


# Variable conversion

To transfer a value between two variable types, you can use the folowing:

    MyString$ = STR$(MyInt)
    MyString$ = STR$(MyFloat)
    
    MyInt = VAL(MyString$)
    MyInt = INT(MyFloat)
    
    MyFloat = VAL(MyString$)
    MyFloat = cFloat(MyFloat)
    

# Arrays

Each type of variable is also available as an array and can be declared like this

    Dim MyStringArray$(100)
    Dim MyStringArray(100) as string
    
    Dim MyIntArray(100)      
    Dim MyIntArray(100) as int
    
    Dim MyFloatArray(100) as float
    
Array can be declared as multidimensional, like:

    Dim MyStringArray$(100,10,4)
    
However, for best performance it is best to stick to arrays with one dimension. So if you want an array of 100 x and y coordinates like:

    Dim Coordinates(100,2)
    
it is best to do it like this:

    Dim corX(100)
    Dim corY(100)
    

# DATA
With the data statement you can store stringdata or numbers in an orderly way. At runtime you can retrieve these values in sequense via de READ function. The function CANREAD returns TRUE if the read-pointer is not yet at the end of the last data statement.

**Example:**

    'sets the read pointer to the begining of the first DATA statement
    RESTORE 
    
    Loop:
        IF CANREAD THEN
            a$ = READ
            PRINT a$ + " ";
        ELSE
            END 'End the program
        END IF
    GOTO Loop
    
    DATA "HELLO","THIS","IS","A","PROGRAM"
    
# RESTORE
Sets the data pointer to the beginning of the first data statement, or to a label (if specified):

**Syntax:**

    RESTORE [label]
    
**Example:**

    
    RESTORE Label2
    PRINT READ      'will print "WOLRD"

    RESTORE Label1
    PRINT READ      'will print "HELLO"
    
    Label1:
    DATA "HELLO"
    
    Label2:
    DATA "WORLD"
