# Functions and subroutines
nxtBasic supports the use of user defined functions and subroutines. The syntax is in line with most basic-style languages, though how the variable scopes are handled is different.

**Syntax:**

    SUB name(arg1,arg2....)
    
    END SUB

    FUNCTION name(arg1,arg2....) as {type}
    
    END FUNCTION
    
**Example:**

    SUB PrintCenter(line$)
        SETCOL GETCOLS()/2 - len(line$)/2
        PRINT line$
    END SUB
    
    Function Multiply(value1 as int,value2 as int) as int
        Multiply = value1*value2    'by assigning a value to the function name, returns the value
    End Function
    
    'Usages:
    PrintCenter("HELLO WORLD")
    
    PRINT Multiply(10,50)

## Variable scope and functions and subroutines
As long as you are not using functions and subs in a recursive way, you do not have to deal with the variable scope. If you do, you want to read the following.

nxtBasic uses one global variable scope. This also includes arguments in functions and subs. So:

    SUB MyFunction(val1,val2)
    END SUB
    
Will result in three extra global variables: MyFunction, val1 and val2. Using one variable scope is the best performing option and is therefor chosen for nxtBasic. Many other programming languages will create a seperate scope for each function and subroutine. The advantage is, that when you recursivly call a function or sub, each 'instance' has its own local variables. In nxtBasic there is a different solution for this.

Before calling a (recursive) sub or function, you can push variables from which you want to keep the value to a variable stack, and after the function is finished, you can pull them of the stack again. 

**Example:**

    v=5
    PushVar(v)
    MySub() 'which uses variable v internaly
    v=PullVar()
    
In this example the value 5 is pushes on the variable stack, the subroutine 'MySub' is called, and then the value 5 is retrieved from the stack and put in variable 'v'.

Important: You have to keep track yourself of all vars you push and pull from the stack and keep them balanced. And if you push more then one var to the stack, you have to retrieve them in the reversed order.
