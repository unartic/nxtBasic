# Screen, keyboard and mouse operations

Input and output operations are essential for interacting with the user and displaying results. This section will cover the statements and functions you'll need for your programs.


# PRINT Statement
The PRINT statement is used to display text and variable values on the screen.

**Syntax:**

PRINT expression

**Example:**

    PRINT "Hello, World!"

You can also display the values of variables:

    x = 10
    PRINT "The value of x is: " + STR$(x)

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand "?" to perform the same action:

    ? "Hello, World!"

If you end the statement with a semicolon, the cursor will not go to the beginning of the next line.

    ? "Hello,";
    ? "World!"    'Will output: Hello, World

# INPUT Function
The INPUT function is used to read input from the user. You can prompt the user with a question and store the input in a variable.

**Syntax:**
    
    a$ = INPUT("Question")

**Example:**

    name$ = INPUT("Enter your name: ")
    PRINT "Hello, " + name$


# GET Function
The GET function returns a key from the keyboard buffer if any key is pressed. This function is useful for capturing user input without waiting.

**Syntax:**

    key$ = GET

**Example:**

    PRINT "Press any key to continue"
    WaitForKey:
        key$ = GET
    IF Key$="" then goto WaitForKey
   
# KEYDOWN function

The KEYDOWN function checks is a button on the keyboard is currently pressed. This can handle multiple keys being pressed at the same time. 

**Syntax:**

    value = KEYDOWN(keycode)
    
Keycode is NOT an ascii/petscii character. See https://cx16forum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6559 for which codes to use.
    
**Example:**

    IF KEYDOWN($53) THEN 
        PRINT "Arrow Up is pressed"
    END IF

# KEYMAP
 Set the current keyboard layout.
 
**Syntax:**

    KEYMAP string

**Example:**

    KEYMAP "SV-SE"  'set keyboard layout to swedisch
 

# LOCATE Statement
The LOCATE statement positions the cursor at a specified row and column on the screen.

**Syntax:**

    LOCATE row, col

**Example:**

    LOCATE 5, 10
    PRINT "This text starts at row 5, column 10"


#CLS Statement

The CLS statement clears the screen, removing all text and resetting the cursor position to the top-left corner.

**Syntax:**

    CLS

**Example:**

    PRINT "This will be cleared"
    CLS


# COLOR Statement
The COLOR statement sets the foreground and optionally the background color for text output. If only one argument is given, only the foreground color will change.

**Syntax:**

    COLOR foreground [, background]

**Example:**

    COLOR 2     ' Sets the foreground color to red
    COLOR 4, 7  ' Sets the foreground color to purple and background color to yellow

- 11 = Dark grey
- 12 = Grey
- 13 = Light green
- 14 = Light blue
- 15 = LIght grey


# POS Function
The POS function returns the current column position of the cursor. This is useful for determining where the cursor is located on the current line.

**Syntax:**

    column = POS

**Example:**

    n
    PRINT "Hello"
    currentColumn = POS
    PRINT "The cursor is at column: " + STR$(currentColumn)


# MOUSE statement

Displays or hides the mouse cursor.

**Syntax:**

    MOUSE value 
    
**Example:**
    
    MOUSE 1     'enables the mouse
    MOUSE 0     'disables the mouse
    
# MX

Returns the current x-coordinate of the mouse pointer

**Syntax:**

    var = MX 
    
**Example:**

    mouseX=MX

# MY

Returns the current y-coordinate of the mouse pointer

**Syntax:**

    var = MY 
    
**Example:**

    mouseY=MY

# MB

Returns a value which indicates which mouse buttons are currently down.

**Syntax:**

    var = MB 

Return:
- 0 = no mouse buttons down
- 1 = left mouse button is down
- 2 = right mouse button is down
- 4 = third mouse button is down
  
**Example:**

    IF MB=2 THEN
        PRINT "Right mouse button is down"
    END IF
    
# MWHEEL

Return the mouse scroll wheel movement since the value was last read. The value is negative if the scroll wheel is moved away from the user, and positive if it is moved towards the user. The range of the returned value is -128 to +127.

**Syntax:**

    var = MWHEEL 

  
**Example:**

    varInt = MWHEEL
