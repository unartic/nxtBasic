# Miscellaneous 
The following function do not realy belong to any of the above categories. Therefor you'll find them here.

## END
Ends the program and returns to BASIC.

**Syntax:**
    
    END
    
## TI
Returns the jiffy timer value.

**Syntax:**
    
    varInt = TI
    
**Example:**

    oldTI = TI
    FOR i = 1 to 10000
        SLEEP 2
    NEXT    
    PRINT "The for-next loop took " + STR$(TI-oldTI) + " jiffys to execute"

## TI$
The TI$ function returns the current time in the format "HHMMSS" (hours, minutes, seconds).

**Syntax:**
    
    varString = TI$

## DA$
The DA$ function returns the current date in the format "MMDDYY" (month, day, year).

**Syntax:**
    
    varString = DA$
    
## MON
The MON statement switches the system into monitor mode, often used for debugging.

**Syntax:**
    
    MON
    
## REM
To add comments to your source code, you can use REM or ' and start writing your comment.

**Example:**
    
    'This is a valid comment
    PRINT "Hello world"     REM this is also a valid comment
    
## SLEEP
The SLEEP function pauses program execution for a specified number of jiffys. A jiffy is 1/60 of a second. So to pause execution for one second, you set the value to 60.

**Syntax:**
    
    SLEEP jiffys

**Example:**

    SLEEP 60    'pauses for one second
    
## CHAIN
If your program is to large to fit in lower memory, or if you want to split your program into multiple prg-files for other reasons, you can use CHAIN to jump from one PRG to another PRG. 

**Syntax:**
    
    CHAIN string

**Example:**

    CHAIN "program2.prg"   'loads program2.prg into memory, end starts executing it
    
In order to exchange variables between programs, you can use the variable stack.

**Example:**

    'Program 1:
    a$="HELLO"
    b$="WORLD"
    PushVar a$
    PushVar b$
    
    CHAIN "program2.prg"
    
    'then in program2.bas:
    b$=PullVar()    'Reversed order!!
    a$=PullVar()
    PRINT a$    'this will print "HELLO"
    PRINT b$    'this will print "WORLD"
