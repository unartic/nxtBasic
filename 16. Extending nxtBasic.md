# Extending nxtBasic
nxtBasic is designed to be highly adaptable to any circumstance. Therefore, extending the default instruction set is easy. This allows you to add your own assembly routines as basic commands within nxtBasic. In fact, almost all built-in Basic commands are assembly routines.

## Including your own functions
To include your own functions, you can add them to any text file and include them in your basic source with the #INCLUDEASM directive.

**Example:**
    
    #INCLUDEASM "custom.s"
    
This will read 'custom.s' from the main program's source directory and import it as basic commands. It does not matter if you have basic commands in there that you do not use in the program you're including it in. nxtBasic will only extract the commands you use to keep the PRG file as small as possible.

## Structure of a function
In your include file, you can define as many functions as you like using the following format:

    func "{COMMANDNAME}({arguments}) as {type}":"{asmlabel}"
        {asmlabel}:
            ;your assembly code
        rts
    endfunc: 

This might look a little complicated, so let's use an example:

    func "PRINTC(STRING) as INT":"PrintCenter"
        
        PrintCenter:
        
        
        rts
    endfunc:
    
In this example, we are defining a new basic command with the name PRINTC, which accepts one argument of type STRING and returns an integer. When you call this command from Basic, the compiler ensures that the assembly routine starting with the label 'PrintCenter' is called.

This function is intended to print a string in the middle of the current row of the screen, and upon completion, it returns the row number where the string is printed.

## Reading arguments
If you want to pass arguments to your custom function, you have to define them in the {arguments} section of the function definition. The compiler will use this for syntax checking.

**Example:**

    func "MYFUNC(STRING,STRING,STRING|INT)":"MyFunc"
    
This function, MYFUNC, requires three arguments: a string, another string, and a string or an integer. A call to this function from Basic would look like:

    MYFUNC "HELLO","WORLD",100
    
The arguments are pushed onto an internal stack by nxtBasic, for you to retrieve from this stack in reverse order. Retrieving the arguments looks like this:

    func "MYFUNC(STRING,STRING,STRING|INT)":"MyFunc"
        MyFunc:
            jsr PopBuffer   ;this will retrieve the last argument (100)

            jsr PopBuffer   ;this will retrieve the second argument "WORLD"

            jsr PopBuffer   ;this will retrieve the first argument "HELLO"
            
        rts
    endfunc:
    
After using 'jsr PopBuffer' nxtBasic will populate the following memory locations:

- WorkBuffer
- WorkBufferLen
- WorkBufferType

### WorkBuffer
WorkBuffer points to a memory location of a maximum of 1024 bytes long. It will contain the value of the argument after PopBuffer is called. If the argument type is a string, the string is populated. If it is an integer, the first byte contains the low byte of the value, and the second byte contains the high byte. For example, if you pass a decimal value of 1000, WorkBuffer will be $E8 03. Any subsequent bytes are meaningless.

### WorkBufferLen
WorkBufferLen points to a 2-byte memory location containing the length of the argument (up to 1024 bytes).
- In the case of a string, it will contain the length of the string.
- In the case of an integer, it will always contain the value 2.
- In the case of a float, it will always contain the value 5 (as a float is 5 bytes long).

### WorkBufferType
WorkBufferType contains a one-byte value indicating the argument type:
- 1 -> integer
- 2 -> string
- 3 -> float

## Returning a value
If you have defined that your function returns a value, you must push that value onto the internal stack. To do so, you have to populate WorkBuffer, WorkBufferLen, and WorkBufferType with the correct values.

For example, to return an integer with a decimal value of 1234:

    ;Set the return type to integer
    lda #1
    sta WorkBufferType

    ;Set the return length to 2 (as an integer is always 2 bytes)
    lda #2
    sta WorkBufferLen
    stz WorkBufferLen+1
    
    ;Store the value to return
    lda #$D2
    sta WorkBuffer
    lda #$04
    sta WorkBuffer+1
    
    ;Push the returnvalue on the internal stack
    jsr PushBuffer
    
    

## Temporary storage
If you need to store some temporary data, there are four locations in memory you can freely use and expect to contain garbage data whenever your function is called:
- temp
- temp2
- temp3
- temp4
  
These all have a maximum length of 5 bytes.

## Important notes
- Always pop as many arguments from the internal stack as you've specified in the function definition.
- Always push a value onto the internal stack if you have defined that you'll return a value.

## Assembly language
nxtBasic uses a custom-built assembler. This means some advanced features you might be used to with your first-choice assembler are not available. The full 6502 instruction set is available, so everything is possible to do. For specific examples, feel free to browse through '/asm/basic-functions.s'.
