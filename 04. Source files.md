# Source files
nxtBasic does not need any specifics regarding source files. You can use your editor of choice and filename and extention of choice. You can structure the sourcefiles als you please, work with indentation, multiple lines on one line with the semicolon etc.

## Including other source files
In order to include other sourcefiles, you can use the #INCLUDE directive. You can use the include directive at any line in your sourcecode. It needs to be the only item om that source line.

**Syntax:**

    #INCLUDE "filename"
    
The filename can not be a variable of a constant, it has to be types on the same line as the #INCLUDE directive.

**Example:**

    #INCLUDE "math.bas"
    
This will 'insert' the contents of the file 'math.bas' at the location of the #INCLUDE directive.

#INCLUDE directives are recursive with an inlimited depth. So you can include a source file which on itself also has includes. Ofcourse avoid an inclusing circle, as that will lead to an infinite loop.
