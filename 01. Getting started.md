# Getting Started with nxtBasic

## Introduction to nxtBasic

Welcome to nxtBasic, a modern compiler inspired by the classics like QuickBasic and PowerBasic, tailored specifically for the Commander X16. nxtBasic empowers you to create fast, powerful programs and games, harnessing the full capabilities of the Commander X16.

### Key Features

- **Ease of Use**: Simple syntax and intuitive commands make programming accessible, even for beginners.
- **High Performance**: nxtBasic focuses on delivering extremely fast execution of code.
- **Rich Functionality**: Comprehensive support for graphics, sound, and other Commander X16 features.

## System Requirements

nxtBasic is designed to be flexible and versatile, running on virtually any operating system. Compiled programs can be tested using the Commander X16 Emulator or transferred to a physical Commander X16.

- **Operating Systems**: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **Commander X16 Emulator**: (optional) For testing and debugging

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Download nxtBasic**:
   - Visit the [download section](Download) to download the latest zip-file, or [click this link](https://github.com/unartic/nxtBasic/raw/main/Download/nxtBasic-0.1b.zip) to start downloading the latest release.

2. **Unpack the Zip-File**:
   - Extract the contents of the zip-file to a directory of your choice. You should see the following directory structure and files:
```
    /asm
    /asm/basic-functions.s
    /asm/global-functions.s
    /asm/global-constants.s
    /nxtbasic.exe
    /nxtbasic.ini
```
(a folder with example programs is also provided)

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Use your favorite text editor to write your nxtBasic programs. Popular choices include VSCode, Sublime Text, or even classic editors like Notepad++.

4. **Compile Your Program**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you extracted nxtBasic.
   - Run the nxtBasic compiler with your source file:
     ```
     nxtBasic yourprogram.bas
     ```
   - This will compile your BASIC code into machine code executable by the Commander X16.

5. **Command line arguments**:
   
   ```nxtBasic <source.bas> [-o output.prg] [-debug] [-run]```

   - -o -> if not specified, nxtBasic wil use the name of the source filename, and replaces the extention with 'prg'. If you want a different output file, you can specify by the -o option.
   - -debug -> nxtBasic wil create a folder /debug (if needed) and writes several files to it when compiling, for debugging purposes.
   - -run -> if the program has compiled succesful, nxtBasic runs it in the Commander X16 Emulator automaticly. In order for nxtBasic to know where the emulator is on your disk drive and which command line arguments you want to pass, you can set it in nxtBasic.ini.


## Debugging and Running Your Programs

### Using the Commander X16 Emulator

1. **Download the Emulator**:
   - Get the latest version of the Commander X16 Emulator from the [official website](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-emulator/releases/).

2. **Run the Emulator**:
If your compiled program is in the same directory as the emulator, you can run the emulator like this:
```
    x16emu  [enter]
```    
To load and run your program, you can then type:
```
    LOAD "YOURPROGRAM.PRG"   [ENTER]
    RUN                      [ENTER]
```
    
Alternativelt you can also load and run your program via de command prompt:
```
    x16emu -prg yourprogram.prg -run
``` 
The emulator provides a convenient way to debug and iterate on your programs without needing the physical hardware. For more information and documentation visit the [official website](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-emulator)
