4. **Compile Your Program**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you extracted nxtBasic.
   - Run the nxtBasic compiler with your source file:
     ```
     nxtBasic yourprogram.bas
     ```
   - This will compile your BASIC code into machine code executable by the Commander X16.

### Example Program



## Debugging and Running Your Programs

### Using the Commander X16 Emulator

1. **Download the Emulator**:
   - Get the latest version of the Commander X16 Emulator from the [official website]([#](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-emulator/releases/)).

2. **Run the Emulator**:
If your compiled program is in the same directory as the emulator, you can run the emulator like this:
```
    x16emu  [enter]
```    
To load and run your program, you can then type:
```
    LOAD "YOURPROGRAM.PRG"   [ENTER]
    RUN                      [ENTER]
```
    
Alternativelt you can also load and run your program via de command prompt:
```
    x16emu -prg yourprogram.prg -run
``` 
The emulator provides a convenient way to debug and iterate on your programs without needing the physical hardware. For more information and documentation visit the [official website](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-emulator)
