# Screen, keyboard and mouse operations

Input and output operations are essential for interacting with the user and displaying results. This section will cover the statements and functions you'll need for your programs.


# PRINT Statement
The PRINT statement is used to display text and variable values on the screen.

**Syntax:**

PRINT expression

**Example:**

    PRINT "Hello, World!"

You can also display the values of variables:

    x = 10
    PRINT "The value of x is: " + STR$(x)

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand "?" to perform the same action:

    ? "Hello, World!"

If you end the statement with a semicolon, the cursor will not go to the beginning of the next line.

    ? "Hello,";
    ? "World!"    'Will output: Hello, World

# SETINDENT
Sets a default indent for the PRINT command.

**Syntax:**
    
    SETINDENT value

**Example:**

    SETINDENT 10
    FOR i = 1 to 10
        PRINT "THIS IS LINE " + STR$(i)     'printed with 10 chars indentation
    NEXT
    

# INPUT Function
The INPUT function is used to read input from the user. You can prompt the user with a question and store the input in a variable.

**Syntax:**
    
    a$ = INPUT("Question")

**Example:**

    name$ = INPUT("Enter your name: ")
    PRINT "Hello, " + name$


# GET Function
The GET function returns a key from the keyboard buffer if any key is pressed. This function is useful for capturing user input without waiting.

**Syntax:**

    key$ = GET

**Example:**

    PRINT "Press any key to continue"
    WaitForKey:
        key$ = GET
    IF Key$="" then goto WaitForKey
   
# KEYDOWN function

The KEYDOWN function checks is a button on the keyboard is currently pressed. This can handle multiple keys being pressed at the same time. 

**Syntax:**

    value = KEYDOWN(keycode)
    
Keycode is NOT an ascii/petscii character. See https://cx16forum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6559 for which codes to use.
    
**Example:**

    IF KEYDOWN($53) THEN 
        PRINT "Arrow Up is pressed"
    END IF

# KEYMAP
 Set the current keyboard layout.
 
**Syntax:**

    KEYMAP string

**Example:**

    KEYMAP "SV-SE"  'set keyboard layout to swedisch
 

# LOCATE Statement
The LOCATE statement positions the cursor at a specified row and column on the screen.

**Syntax:**

    LOCATE row, col

**Example:**

    LOCATE 5, 10
    PRINT "This text starts at row 5, column 10"

# SETCOL Statement
Position the cursor on a specified columns on the current row. Especially useful if you want to print multiple lines on the same offset.

**Syntax:**

    SETCOL col

**Example:**

    LOCATE 5, 10
    PRINT "This text starts at row 5, column 10"
    SETCOL 10
    PRINT "This text starts at row 6, column 10"
    

# CLS Statement

The CLS statement clears the screen, removing all text and resetting the cursor position to the top-left corner.

**Syntax:**

    CLS

**Example:**

    PRINT "This will be cleared"
    CLS


# COLOR Statement
The COLOR statement sets the foreground and optionally the background color for text output. If only one argument is given, only the foreground color will change.

**Syntax:**

    COLOR foreground [, background]

**Example:**

    COLOR 2     ' Sets the foreground color to red
    COLOR 4, 7  ' Sets the foreground color to purple and background color to yellow
    
**Colors:**
- 0 = Black
- 1 = White
- 2 = Red
- 3 = Cyan
- 4 = Violet / purple
- 5 = Green
- 6 = Blue
- 7 = Yellow
- 8 = Orange
- 9 = Brown
- 10 = Light red
- 11 = Dark grey
- 12 = Grey
- 13 = Light green
- 14 = Light blue
- 15 = LIght grey


# POS Function
The POS function returns the current column position of the cursor. This is useful for determining where the cursor is located on the current line.

**Syntax:**

    column = POS

**Example:**

    n
    PRINT "Hello"
    currentColumn = POS
    PRINT "The cursor is at column: " + STR$(currentColumn)


# MOUSE statement

Displays or hides the mouse cursor.

**Syntax:**

    MOUSE value 
    
**Example:**
    
    MOUSE 1     'enables the mouse
    MOUSE 0     'disables the mouse
    
# MX

Returns the current x-coordinate of the mouse pointer

**Syntax:**

    var = MX 
    
**Example:**

    mouseX=MX

# MY

Returns the current y-coordinate of the mouse pointer

**Syntax:**

    var = MY 
    
**Example:**

    mouseY=MY

# MB

Returns a value which indicates which mouse buttons are currently down.

**Syntax:**

    var = MB 

Return:
- 0 = no mouse buttons down
- 1 = left mouse button is down
- 2 = right mouse button is down
- 4 = third mouse button is down
  
**Example:**

    IF MB=2 THEN
        PRINT "Right mouse button is down"
    END IF
    
# MWHEEL

Return the mouse scroll wheel movement since the value was last read. The value is negative if the scroll wheel is moved away from the user, and positive if it is moved towards the user. The range of the returned value is -128 to +127.

**Syntax:**

    var = MWHEEL 

  
**Example:**

    varInt = MWHEEL

# JOYBUTTONS
With the JOYBUTTONS function, you can get the state of the buttons from a specified joystick. Commander X16 supports 4 SNESS gamepads and 1 virtual gamepad through the keyboard.

**Syntax:**

    varString$ = JOYBUTTONS(joynr)
    
- joynr is a value between 0 and 4 
  - 0=keyboard 
  - 1=SNESS controler 1
  - 2=SNESS controler 2
  - 3=SNESS controler 3
  - 4=SNESS controler 4
  
The function returns an empty string if the joystick is not connected. If the joystick is connected, it returns a 12-byte string, where each byte is either "0" or "1". Each byte corresponds to a specific button on the joystick: "0" indicates the button is not pressed, while "1" indicates the button is pressed. For example, if the third byte is "1", it means the Select button is currently being pressed.

---
|Position|Button|
|-|-|
|1|Button B|
|2|Button Y|
|3|Button Select|
|4|Button Start|
|5|Button Up|
|6|Button Down|
|7|Button Left|
|8|Button Right|
|9|Button A|
|10|Button X|
|11|Button Left shoulder|
|12|Button Right shoulder|
---

**Example:**

    cls

    Loop:
        locate 0,0
        
        'Get button state of the virtual joystick (keyboard)
        a$ = JOYBUTTONS(0)
        
        'Checks if position 5 in the resturn string is 1
        if mid$(a$,5,1)="1" then 
            print "UP"
        else
            Print "  "
        end if

        if mid$(a$,6,1)="1" then 
            print "DOWN"
        else
            Print "    "
        end if

        if mid$(a$,7,1)="1" then 
            print "LEFT"
        else
            Print "    "
        end if

        if mid$(a$,8,1)="1" then 
            print "RIGHT"
        else
            Print "     "
        end if
        
    goto Loop

This example polls the state of the virtual joystick (the keyboard) and checks if any of the arrow keys are being pressed.

# ISO mode
Commander X16 supports ISO mode.To quickly enter iso mode or exit iso mode, use the following statenents:

## ENTERISO
Enters iso mode and loads the appropriate character set. This enables lower case characters for example.

**Syntax/Example:**

    ENTERISO
    
## EXITISO
Exits iso mode and resets the appropriate character set.

**Syntax/Example:**

    EXITISO
