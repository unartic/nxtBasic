# Memory maniuplation

nxtBasic uses all of low ram and the first 15 banks of highram. Other ram is available for you to use. To do this you can use the following functions:

## BANK
Sets the rambank and optionally the rombank.

**Syntax:**

    BANK rambank,[rombank]

**Example:**

    BANK 15     'sets the rambank to bank 15
    
## PEEK
Returns the value stored at the specified memory address. The value returned will be in the range of 0 to 255.

**Syntax:**
    
    varInt = PEEK(address)
    
**Example:**

    'Reads the value at address $0810 and saves it into 'value'
    value = PEEK($0810)

## PEEKN
Returns a string of bytes stored at the specified memory address. 

**Syntax:**
    
    varString = PEEKN(address,length)

- address: the address to start reading
- length: the amount of bytes to read (max 1024)
    
**Example:**

    'Reads 10 bytes at address $0810 and saves it into a$
    a$ = PEEK$($0810,10)

## POKE
Stores a value into a specific memory location.

**Syntax:**
    
    POKE address,value

Value can be a one byte string or an integer.
    
**Example:**

    'Stored "A" into memory location $A000
    POKE $A000,"A"

## POKEN
Stores a string into a specific memory location.

**Syntax:**
    
    POKEN address,string

- address: the address to start writing
- string: the string to write to the specified address
    
**Example:**

    'Stored "A" into memory location $A000
    a$="HELLO WORLD"
    POKEN $A000,a$
