# CBM Basic
If you have experience with CBM Basic, you'll find many similarities with nxtBasic. nxtBasic uses the Commander X16 BASIC subset as its default and has been extended from there. Although most of the functions are rewritten, in some cases, Kernel functions from the Commander X16 are called directly.

However, even though nxtBasic is highly compatible with CBM Basic, simply trying to compile a CBM Basic file will often not work directly. The main reason is that nxtBasic defaults to integer variable types, while CBM Basic defaults to floating point. Therefore, many functions that accept a number will need a float in CBM Basic and an int in nxtBasic. Additionally, there are subtle differences.

Known differences and important information are outlined here:

## 1. Integer-Based Language
nxtBasic is an integer-based language. This means that if you do:

    A = 5

a variable named "A" of type Integer is created. In this case, a signed 16-bit integer.

If you want to use a floating point variable, you have to explicitly set it like this:
			
    DIM A as float
    A = 5

Now A is a floating point variable with the value 5.0

## 2. Line Numbers and Labels
Although you can use line numbers like in CBM BASIC, it is not necessary. For readability, it is better to use text labels like:

    MyLabel:

    Goto MyLabel

## 3. String Variables
String variables are dynamic and can be a maximum of 1024 bytes long.

## 4. Spaces in Syntax
You have to use spaces to separate elements. So:

    FORX=1TO5
	
is not acceptable. It should be:

	FOR X = 1 TO 5

## 5. Variable Data Storage
All variable data is stored in high RAM (memory banks), allowing you to write large programs in nxtBasic.

## 6. Variable Names
Variable names can be of any length and are always uniquely treated. So you can use variable names like POINTX and POINTY, as the full variable name is used to identify it.

## 7. PRINT multiple elements

    PRINT “LEFT”  “RIGHT”  
is not valid. Should be: 

    PRINT “LEFT” + “RIGHT”
    
## 8. Random Values in Integer Space 
To use random values in integer space, you can use **RNDINT(maxvalue)**. So:

    A=RNDINT(100)

will return an integer value between 0 and 100.

## 9. FOR-NEXT Loop Values
The values in a FOR-NEXT loop have to be integers. So:

    FOR x = 1.25 to 5 step 0.25

is not valid.
