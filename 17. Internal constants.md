# Internal constants
nxtBasic has several internal constants for you to use which are listed below:

- True
- False

## 16 bit registers
The Commander X16 has so called 16-bit registers with names like r0, r1, r2H etc. These point to specific memorylocation. All these registers are available as constants in nxtBasic to simplify peek and poke to them.

- reg.r0 to reg.r15
- reg.r0L to reg.r15L
- reg.r0H to reg.r15H

**Example:**

    POKE reg.r3L,$15
