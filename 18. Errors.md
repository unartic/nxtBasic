# Errors

Errors during compiling are self explaining. They contain a message and a linenumber to look for. Error checking in the current version is somewhat limited. The compiler will find most obvious errors, but there will be cases where the compiler will not find an error, while the compiled program will not run or gives a runtime error. At this point however, I think there is no real need for more extensive error checking.

## Runtime
To allow for fast speeds, error checking in runtime is very limited, though probably good enough.

When an error at runtime occures, the message "ERROR" is printed, followed by a number. These are the errorcodes you can expect:

- 0: Your are using a READ statement for a data element which is not an integer, float or string
- 1: Variable identifier not found.
- 3: End of buffer stack reached. This is most likely to be an syntax error where you use less parameters (for example dimensions in array) then expected.
- 5: Operant type mismatch. A float was expected
- 6: You try to read from a variable of unknown type
